Got into his machine via flashdrive drop #6(fake_bitcoin_account).
Initial foothold through autorun_shell_dropper.py.

Went deeper thinking he was a nexabank employee, but I was wrong.
Was actually a student, and an intern web developer at TechFort solutions.
We have the same struggles, high student debt from nexabank, REGRET. I called off my attack. 

Still, interesting system structure. SMB credentials were just like mine. 
his SMB username is ollie_ftp, and mine is francisco_smb
Same format. No imagination. lol

Date: April 18, 2025  
To: All Concerned Parties  
Subject: Closure of Case ID #TF-APR16-OP

After a full internal review and with the assistance of Oursafe cybersecurity team and forensic advisors, TechFort Solutions has officially cleared Mr. Oliver Parker of all accusations pertaining to:
  • Breach of data security protocols  
  • Negligence in handling sensitive company hardware  
  • Unauthorized third-party software installations

The investigation was re-opened following the emergence of new digital evidence provided by Oursafe task force during a simulated security audit.

Key findings:
- Mr. Parker was unknowingly targeted by an external USB-based payload (origin: UNKNOWN).
- No signs of intentional tampering or complicity were found.
- The breach attempt was halted and neutralized shortly after internal monitoring detected unusual activity.

As of this notice:
✔ All internal charges have been dropped.  
✔ Mr. Parker has been fully reinstated as a Junior Web Developer, with a temporary advisory role pending review.  
✔ A joint task team has been formed to pursue leads regarding the real perpetrator(s).

Mr. Parker will be subject to a debriefing and will assist in documenting the incident as part of our training simulations for future awareness campaigns.

We extend our appreciation to Oursafe cybersecurity redteam taskforce who exposed the truth and helped clear a name unfairly caught in the crossfire.
